# Data Visualization Project Proposal

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is ...

| # | Variable | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Clientnum | Num | Unique identifier for the customer |
| 2 | Attrition_Flag | Cat | Internal event (customer activity) variable |
| 3 | Customer_Age | Num | Customer's Age in Years |
| 4 | Gender | Cat | M=Male, F=Female |
| 5 | Dependent_count | Num | Number of dependents |
| 6 | Education_Level | Cat | Educational Qualification of the account holder |
| 7 | Marital_Status | Cat | Married, Single, Unknown |
| 8 | Income_Category | Cat | Annual Income Category of the account holder (< $40K, $40K - 60K, $60K - $80K, ...) |
| 9 | Card_Category | Cat | Type of Card (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) |
| 10 | Months_on_book | Num | Months on book (Time of Relationship) |
| 11 | Total_Relationship_Count | Num | Total no. of products held by the customer |
| 12 | Months_Inactive_12_mon | Num | No. of months inactive in the last 12 months |
| 13 | Contacts_Count_12_mon | Num | No. of Contacts in the last 12 months |
| 14 | Credit_Limit | Num | Credit Limit on the Credit Card |
| 15 | Total_Revolving_Bal | Num | Total Revolving Balance on the Credit Card |
| 16 | Avg_Open_To_Buy | Num | Open to Buy Credit Line (Average of last 12 months) |
| 17 | Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1 | Num | Change in Transaction Amount (Q4 over Q1)  |
| 18 | Total_Trans_Amt | Num | Total Transaction Amount (Last 12 months) |
| 19 | Total_Trans_Ct | Num | Total Transaction Count (Last 12 months) |
| 20 | Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1 | Num | Change in Transaction Count (Q4 over Q1)  |
| 21 | Avg_Utilization_Ratio | Num | Average Card Utilization Ratio |

Attributes Type: -Attrition_Flag: categorical -Customer_Age: quantitative -Gender: categorical -Education_Level: categorical -Income_Category: categorical -Months_on_book: quantitative -Credit_Limit: quantitative -Total_Revolving_Bal: quantitative -Avg_Open_To_Buy: quantitative -Total_Trans_Amt: quantitative -Avg_Utilization_Ratio: quantitative

- -Is there a relationship between attrition flag and age, education level or income category? -? - -Do people with higher education level use the credit card more? -Is there a correlation between utilization ratio and age or months on book?

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there a relationship between age and income category?
 * How do income categories compare to each other in terms of credit limits and utilization ratios?
 * Do female customers use the credit card more than male customers?
 * Do people with higher education level use the credit cards more?
 * Is there a relationship between attrition flag and age, education level or income category?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
