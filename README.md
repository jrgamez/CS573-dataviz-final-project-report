# Data Visualization Project Proposal

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is ...

| # | Variable | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Contenido de la celda  | Contenido de la celda  |
| Contenido de la celda  | Contenido de la celda  |

Attributes Type: -Attrition_Flag: categorical -Customer_Age: quantitative -Gender: categorical -Education_Level: categorical -Income_Category: categorical -Months_on_book: quantitative -Credit_Limit: quantitative -Total_Revolving_Bal: quantitative -Avg_Open_To_Buy: quantitative -Total_Trans_Amt: quantitative -Avg_Utilization_Ratio: quantitative

- -Is there a relationship between attrition flag and age, education level or income category? -? - -Do people with higher education level use the credit card more? -Is there a correlation between utilization ratio and age or months on book?

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there a relationship between age and income category?
 * How do income categories compare to each other in terms of credit limits and utilization ratios?
 * Do female customers use the credit card more than male customers?
 * Do people with higher education level use the credit cards more??

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
